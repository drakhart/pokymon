  description: "Raticate is a large, rodent-like Pok\xE9mon. Although it is often
    depicted on its hind legs, it is a quadruped. It is primarily tawny-colored with
    a cream underside. It has narrow black eyes, ears with ragged edges and dark
    insides, and large incisors that grow constantly. There are three whiskers on
    each side of its face, which it uses to maintain balance. It has short arms with
    three-fingered hands and webbed feet with three toes. The webbing on its feet
    allows it to swim. Its tail is long and scaly. A female will have shorter whiskers
    and lighter fur."
