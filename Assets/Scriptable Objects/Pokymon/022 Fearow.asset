  _description: "Fearow is a large, mostly brown avian Pok\xE9mon with a vulturine
    neck and broad, powerful wings. It has a long, pointed, pink beak and a decorative
    red coxcomb on top of its head. Its narrow eyes have very small pupils and do
    not appear to have colored irises. It has shaggy, feathers at the base of its
    neck and covering the upper portion of its wings. These feathers are cream-colored,
    as are the tips of its flight feathers. Its sharp-clawed talons are pink, with
    three toes pointing forward and one pointing backward."
