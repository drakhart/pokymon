  description: "Kakuna is a yellow, insect cocoon-like Pok\xE9mon. Kakuna has a dome-shaped
    head and black, triangular eyes with glowing white pupils. It has two scythe-like
    arms in the middle of its body. When it comes close to evolving, its body gives
    off heat that makes it warm to the touch. Kakuna remains virtually immobile and
    waits for evolution, often hanging from tree branches by long strands of silk.
    When attacked, however, it can extend its poison barbs. Kakuna nests in temperate
    forests and misty wooded areas. Occasionally, it will also nest at the mouth
    of tunnels and caves, as seen in Pok\xE9mon Snap."
