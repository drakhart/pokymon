  description: "Butterfree is an insect Pok\xE9mon which resembles a vaguely anthropomorphic
    butterfly with a purple body. Unlike true insects, it only has two body segments
    and four light blue legs. The upper pair of its legs resemble small, three-fingered
    hands, while the lower pair resembles long, digit-less feet. Butterfree has two
    black antennae, a light blue snout with two fangs underneath, and large, red
    compound eyes. Its two pairs of wings are white with black venation. Two oval
    scales on a female Butterfree's lower wings are black, but they are white on
    a male."
