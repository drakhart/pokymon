  _description: "Charmeleon is a bipedal, reptilian Pok\xE9mon. It has dark red scales
    and a cream underside from the chest down. It has blue eyes and a long snout
    with a slightly hooked tip. On the back of its head is a single horn-like protrusion.
    It has relatively long arms with three sharp claws. Its short legs have plantigrade
    feet with three claws and cream-colored soles. The tip of its long, powerful
    tail has a flame burning on it. The temperature rises to unbearable levels if
    Charmeleon swings its tail."
