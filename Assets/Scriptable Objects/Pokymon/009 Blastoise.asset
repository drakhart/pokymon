  description: "Blastoise is a large, bipedal turtle Pok\xE9mon. Its body is blue
    and is mostly hidden by its tough, brown shell. This shell has a cream-colored
    underside and a white ridge encircling its arms and separating the upper and
    lower halves. Two powerful water cannons reside at the top of its shell over
    its shoulders. These cannons can be extended or withdrawn. Blastoise's head has
    triangular ears that are black on the inside, small brown eyes, and a cream-colored
    lower jaw. Its arms are thick, and it has three claws on each hand. Its feet
    have three claws on the front and one on the back. Poking out of the bottom of
    its shell is a stubby tail."
