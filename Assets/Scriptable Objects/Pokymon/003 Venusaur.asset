  description: "Venusaur is a squat, quadrupedal amphibian Pok\xE9mon with bumpy,
    blue-green skin. It has small, circular red eyes; a short, blunt snout; and a
    wide mouth with two pointed teeth in the upper jaw and four in the lower jaw.
    On top of its head are small, pointed ears with reddish pink insides. It has
    three clawed toes on each foot. The bud on its back has bloomed into a large
    pink, white-spotted flower. The flower is supported by a thick, brown trunk surrounded
    by green fronds. A female Venusaur will have a seed in the center of its flower."
