  description: "Pidgeot is an avian Pok\xE9mon with large wings, sharp talons, and
    a short, hooked beak. Its glossy plumage is mostly brown with cream-colored underparts
    and flight feathers. Its head has a decorated crest that is nearly as long as
    its body. The center feathers of its crest are yellow, while the outer feathers
    are red. The fan-like feathers of its tail are red or brown. Its beak and legs
    are pink, and there are three forward-facing toes and one backward-facing toe
    on each foot. Behind each eye is an angular black marking."
