  _description: "Weedle is a larval insect Pok\xE9mon with a segmented body ranging
    in color from yellow to reddish-brown. Each segment of its body is a sphere.
    It has a bulbous red nose, two small, black eyes on its face and two spherical
    feet on each body segment. The combination of red and yellow in its color scheme
    creates a bright warning to predators that it is poisonous. Weedle has a conical,
    two-inch (five centimeter) venomous stinger on its head and a barbed one on its
    tail."
