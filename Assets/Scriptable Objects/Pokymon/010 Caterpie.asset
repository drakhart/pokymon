  _description: "Caterpie is an insect Pok\xE9mon that resembles a green caterpillar
    with a yellow underside and teardrop-shaped tail. There are yellow ring-shaped
    markings down the sides of its segmented body, which resemble its eyes and are
    meant to scare off predators. Its most notable characteristic is the bright red
    antenna (osmeterium) on its head, which releases a stench to repel predators.
    Despite these features and its camouflage in green foliage, Caterpie is often
    preyed upon by Flying-type Pok\xE9mon. Its four tiny feet are tipped with suction
    cups, permitting this Pok\xE9mon to scale most surfaces with minimal effort."
