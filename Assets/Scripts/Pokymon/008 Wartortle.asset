  description: "Wartortle is a bipedal, indigo reptilian Pok\xE9mon similar to a
    turtle. It has brown eyes, a dark blue streak on each cheek, and two sharp teeth
    protruding from its upper jaw. It has three clawed fingers and pointed toes.
    On each side of its head are feather-like ears covered in pale blue fur. A brown
    shell with a pale yellow underside encases its body. A thick, white rim separates
    the upper and lower halves of the shell. An older Wartortle may have scars and
    algae growing on its shell. Poking out of the bottom of the shell is a thick,
    wavy tail that also has light blue fur and cannot be fully withdrawn into its
    shell. Its tail fur will darken with age. Its tail is a popular symbol of longevity
    and good luck, making this Pok\xE9mon popular with the elderly."
