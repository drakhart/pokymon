  description: "Raichu is a bipedal, rodent-like Pok\xE9mon. Raichu is covered in
    dark orange fur with a white belly. Its bifurcated ears are brown on the outside,
    yellow on the insides, and end in a distinctive curl. There is a circular yellow
    marking on each cheek where its electric sacs are, and it has a triangular, dark
    brown nose. Its arms and feet have patches of brown fur at the end, and the soles
    of its long feet are tan with a circular orange pad in the center. On its back
    are two horizontal brown stripes. Its long, thin tail has a lightning bolt-shaped
    end. This lightning bolt is chipped on females. Raichu exudes a weak electrical
    charge from all its body and glows slightly in the dark."
