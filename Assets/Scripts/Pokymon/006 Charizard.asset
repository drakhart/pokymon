  description: "Charizard is a draconic, bipedal Pok\xE9mon. It is primarily orange
    with a cream underside from the chest to the tip of its tail. It has a long neck,
    small blue eyes, slightly raised nostrils, and two horn-like structures protruding
    from the back of its rectangular head. There are two fangs visible in the upper
    jaw when its mouth is closed. Two large wings with blue-green undersides sprout
    from its back, and a horn-like appendage juts out from the top of the third joint
    of each wing. A single wing-finger is visible through the center of each wing
    membrane. Charizard's arms are short and skinny compared to its robust belly,
    and each limb has three white claws. It has stocky legs with cream-colored soles
    on each of its plantigrade feet. The tip of its long, tapering tail burns with
    a sizable flame."
